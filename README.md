# Vagabondstyle

## Overview
First webpage I've fully created, from the design to the implementation and hosting.
If you have any tips or suggestions, feel free to contact me!

## Tools I've used
Created with HTML and CSS (SCSS), with layout based on flexbox. I used simple Javascript - mainly for aestetic purposes - and FormSubmit email service for contact form.

## What I learned
- It gave me rough idea on how my design process should look like, as this was my first project for someone else (or more "with someone else in mind").
- How important it is to check the design on all browsers. In my case both accent waves changed site width on Apple products. I've read that apparently Safari overlooks `overflow` when rendering, so you have to target the body/html tag better.
- Tiny bit of Photoshop. ;)
